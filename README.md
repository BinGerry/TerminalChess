# TerminalChess
Play a game of chess in cmd line or terminal!!

#How To Play
You can play with another player near you or yourself (Sorry, no computer oppenent or online multiplayer)
Like in battle ship, you have to enter a letter and a number like for example E5.  The x-axis is denoted
by letters and the y-axis is denoted by numbers.  The game will tell you rest you need to know.  

#Clarification
I know there are libraries for making a chess game but I wanted to challenge myself in making one from scratch
and the libraries where difficult for me to understand.  Thankyou.
